I'd say the graphics drivers are to blame here. The intel stuff was never exactly stellar... The problem is that it can't handle transparency for some reason. This happened before to other people, mostly with intel drivers/hardware too.\n\nIt's possible to run stonesense in software mode, but that's horribly slow, so I can't really recommend that. \n\n/me wishes he could help\n\nAnyway, if this can be fixed, it's probably in the allegro 5 libraries or in the drivers.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"066ddf297ad18609a03d80c07510fb2286f249b7"},"timestamp":1329951680,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMjY2OTc=","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/stonesense/issues/5#issuecomment-4126697"},"message":"Oh well.

Graphics drivers don't have problems just on linux. Try switching stonesense to OpenGL or DirectX mode, depending on which is currently active. DirectX mode has some other problems though... consuming more memory than it should.\n\nYou can find the settings in init.txt - try to fiddle with it and see if it helps.\n\nAnd that's a very interesting Ш :-)","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"6790946dd548701e70eeeb1d5c94eebf6f371a4e"},"timestamp":1403587627,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTM0NDA3NDA0"},"status":2}]}
