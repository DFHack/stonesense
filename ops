This is a free project. Someone needs to be able to reliably reproduce this issue – and they might not have access to the same hardware, or the same version of DF, DFHack, etc.. And then someone needs to spend their own time – and possibly a considerable amount too – actually investigating the problem, it's likely causes, and what might possibly be done or changed to mitigate or prevent the crashes. That's potentially a LOT of work, and there's little hope of anyone being paid for it, so there's a real [opportunity cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost) – not just in potential paid work not done, but everything else that anyone could be doing instead (including playing DF).\n\nThis is also an open source project. Everyone has access to the source code. So you personally should have access to all of the tools and resources you might need to fix this yourself. I'd suggest starting by compiling and building DFHack – according to [the DF wiki page for Stonesense](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Utility:Stonesense):\n\n\u003e Stonesense is one of the many DFHack plugins. It comes with DFHack's source code, and if you manage to compile DFHack, then you've managed to compile Stonesense.\n\nYes, you might need to learn C++; at least enough to read the code and identify, first, where in the code these crashes occur. Yes, that might be a LOT of work – much more than others that already know C++, let alone know DFHack or Stonesense (to any degree).\n\nBut still, how have YOU not fixed this already? You wrote that these crashes are happening to you too so why do you not seem to care enough to actually pitch in and help fix them for at least yourself?\n\nIt's totally understandable why you haven't done anything. It's almost certainly a LOT of work. And I sympathize with your frustration. But please don't imply that someone has failed to meet an obligation they never made, to you personally or anyone else, to ensure that a free program works forever, perfectly, with every version of DF and DFHack, and on every hardware platform on which DF runs (which is several).\n\nBut flippant remarks like \"How has this not been fixed\" have a real cost on the people that do try and are trying to provide others with awesome free software – don't discourage them and their work by implying that they're failing to meet a standard to which they never agreed. Instead – please – be gracious and grateful for all of the hard work they've already done for both your benefit and everyone else's too.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"6c57a309d9b5e893cbd1f0466a1358b47f137d24"},"timestamp":1601073133,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5OTE4OTkxNQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/stonesense/issues/38#issuecomment-699189915"},"message":"Same,\nWin10, DF v0.44.12 DF-hack version 0.44.12-r2\nUsing 2 monitors, crashes on both.\nFound out, that bug happened only after launching the game.
