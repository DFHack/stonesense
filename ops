My guess is that at least one (possibly both) of DF and Stonesense is doing something unsafe that causes these crashes when *both* are active, but I don't know how to narrow it down further.\n\nAnyway, upgrading Allegro (from 5.0.9 to 5.0.11) has not fixed the issue in the past. I don't want to try it again on my own machine with Allegro 5.2, but feel free to if you want. I don't know if the issue is on the Stonesense/Allegro or DF/SDL side (or both), though.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"43f4b16e1fcce248fcdfefce7860d3ad865a5288"},"timestamp":1513497130,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MjIzODI5OA==","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/stonesense/issues/55#issuecomment-352238298"},"message":"Definitely possible it's both. I've seen processes with multiple OpenGL contexts before, so it's theoretically fixable. You're right that SDL 1.2 is old though, so I could see it using OpenGL incorrectly.\n\nI'm also curious what happens for other modes, like FRAME_BUFFER, VBO, \u0026 TEXT. Surely TEXT won't have an OpenGL conflict?","files":null}]}
