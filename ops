In a default install of your LNP pack, left clicking while in the main menu for me brings up a cursor because of \"query\" part of \"mousequery\" specifically it does a \"look\", \"view items\", \"view items in buildings\" or \"set building prefs\". But surely you know about that. So I must be misunderstanding you here.\n\n@Everyone:\nAs for the offset, I'm also seeing that even in non-overlay mode. It appears to vary with the SEGMENTSIZE_Z, bigger values have much worse offsets in the Y direction for me. My clicks seem to be off by about ( SEGMENTSIZE_Z-2) tiles in the in the downward direction. It almost seems like `GetPosFromScreen` needs to account for the Z segment size, which makes no sense, since the `getScreenFromPos` function (that is the inverse) does not need to account for it. \n\nIn non-overlay mode, how far off my clicks are in the X direction seems to vary. Sometimes it is perfect, and some times it is off by half a tile in either direction.  The X offset looks to be because it is using a grid of squares aligned to the window for mapping purposes, rather than a grid of squares rotated by 45 degrees which would be correct for selecting isometric tiles.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"ab8a0e112efdcc060c75f2462d4006e9e2c60402"},"timestamp":1404225045,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NjYzMDI3","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/stonesense/issues/19#issuecomment-47663027"},"message":"I have a partial fix for this issue.

You must click within the diamond shaped floor area of the tile, or where that floor area would be if not blocked by a wall or object. This can still feel slighly annoying when trying to select an object, but there is no infrastructure in place to support mapping backwards from the pixels of an object to its tile. It should still be far better than the rather random-appearing behavior of previous builds.","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"6790946dd548701e70eeeb1d5c94eebf6f371a4e"},"timestamp":1416541559,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTk2NTc0MzM1"},"status":2}]}
