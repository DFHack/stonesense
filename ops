As mentioned in the title, Stonesense only draws the upper triangle of each tile correctly and paints the lower one black. It looks like this: http://i.imgur.com/uX611.png. I'm currently on Arch Linux and using the i915 graphics driver for the Intel GMA chip.\n\nIs this a known bug? Any idea what's causing it?\n\nEDIT: I should also have mentioned that this happened on 0.31.25 too, since I'm not sure if the 0.34.xx series are supported yet.","files":null}]}
