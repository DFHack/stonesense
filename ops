I have ATI/AMD R9 270x videocard, so fglrx is used. Open source driver from the ubuntu repository didn't provide direct rendering on my configuration, I am not sure why and this was not the big problem for me. The driver which currently works and works fine is the new proprietary AMD driver (14.20 codename Omega) released 4 days ago. It is available for download here: http://support.amd.com/en-us/download/desktop?os=Linux+x86\nWhile release notes point out 3.17 kernel as supported, I hadn't success with compiling DKMS module for it, so I've downgraded the kernel to version 3.16.7\n\nHowever, linuxes, even ubuntu flavors are not Windows. I mean that there are a lot of differences between distributions and configurations. i am not sure that the provided information could be helpful to others.\n\nThe biggest issue here, in my opinion, is unavailability of clues in logs (sterr.log, dfhack.log etc.). I didn't see any information related to the issue, the stonesense window just wasn't redrawing. It could be caused by allegro library or the plugin itself. Also, I am not sure that disabled direct rendering caused the issue, it's just a guess since there are no any other noticable differences for me between these drivers.","files":null}]}
