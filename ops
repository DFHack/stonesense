I suppose refactoring stonesense to run in a separate process would be possible with the RPC api, but quite a large undertaking. \n\nIs killing an allegro thread possible?\n- see: Allegro Thread Documentation(https://mvcdecoder.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/allegro/docs/src/refman/threads.txt)","files":null}]}
