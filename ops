Indeed they can actually be changed independently. They are only combined in the config file. No clue why.\n\nYour formula slightly oversimplifies some things, given the different modes, zooming options, and the functioning of the Z dimention, but the basic concept is valid and reasonable, and would actually make good sense to be the default option. \n\nThere actually is code intended to avoid rendering tiles that are completely outside the view area of the window. I'm not so sure that it is actually working though, since the check for invisible tiles comes earlier in the same method. That probably needs to be fixed.\n\nI don't plan to submit a patch for this one myself, but I would like to see it implemented.","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"b505cbb60ba651400190522029d45f8ed539d93a"},"timestamp":1423090639,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIzMDQxNTgwMA=="},"added":["Feature Request"],"removed":[]}]}
