Maybe there is a config file I can set to determine default zoom level? It would also be nice to pull down the walls. The \"c\" key usually does that. Since, we can only get mouse input, would it be too hard to make double click replace the \"c\" command? Or perhaps you can think of a \"dirty\" way to make the controls work that wouldn't take too much effort? I don't mind difficult to use interface, but having to play zoomed out is kinda rough for me.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"b505cbb60ba651400190522029d45f8ed539d93a"},"timestamp":1562025799,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNzQ2NzY0Mg==","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/stonesense/issues/32#issuecomment-507467642"},"message":"I haven't actually worked with the overlay (not sure if anyone who has is still active); I just know how it works at a high level. It was released as an experimental feature and never really got finished.\nFor zooming, I'd think the scroll wheel would work pretty well, and it shouldn't be too hard to restrict it to when the mouse is over the overlay window itself (at least it's not hard with DF's SDL layer; Stonesense bypasses that and uses Allegro, which I've never really worked with).","files":null}]}
