I ended up resorting to the tile graphics, which is why I never bothered to play DF in the first place 2 years ago.\n\nI now wanted to use stonesense to get a better looking overview of my world while on a second monitor, but it's still all rotated 45°.\n\nWould help greatly if this was adjusted.","files":null}]}
