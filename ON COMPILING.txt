There are ten thousand things to say here, and I'll get into more details later,
but for now; This project aint all that compiler friendly yet.
I'm just getting the project out there, so the public light will force me to tidy up stuff.


1 - I've only tested it with MSVS 2005

2 - On linux, You will need Allegro 5.0.0, the graphics library we use. Get it at http://alleg.sourceforge.net/
	Note that this can be tricky to compile, annd you need to verify that you have all the dependencies, as a few missing ones will
	result in allegro compiling, but not the required modules.

3 - You will also need the latest DFhack as of 2011/01/22, get it from http://github.com/peterix/dfhack

Specific Build Notes
====================

*** MinGW ***

My understanding is that the linking version of DFHack will not compile via MinGW due to DLL compatibiliy issues

*** Linux ***

1) Get the libraries

Your distro should have dev packages for libpng, and zlib
You can also build your own debug allegro libraries if you are particularly adventurous, but that is unnecessary (stonesense comes with prebuild allegro libs) and left as an exercise for the masochistic
You will also need git, make, cmake and a g++

2) Get the source from git

start with a terminal somewhere suitable for putting a dfhack dev area (ie writeable and not too wacky)

> git clone git://github.com/peterix/dfhack.git # read only repo @ https://github.com/peterix/dfhack
> cd dfhack # step into the new directory
> git submodule init # set up the stonesense submodule
> git submodule update # and fetch it from read only repo @ https://github.com/peterix/stonesense

3) Make sure stonesense is set to be built

in dfhack/plugins/CMakeLists.txt, make sure the option
OPTION(BUILD_STONESENSE "Build stonesense (needs a checkout first)." ON)
is actually set to ON

4) Configure the build

assuming your terminal is still pointing at the dfhack area from step 2

> cd build
> make cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:string=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<location_of_df>

note that <location_of_df> should be replaced by the df folder
you could also configure stuff with ccmake if you prefer

4) Actually build stuff

terminal, still in the build directory from step 4

> make
> make install

5) Debug whatever went wrong in step 4 and 5

One possibility is you dont have all the libraries you need (what happens if you google the error message? Is there some package lib<string from the error message> that you could install.

Theres always the chance that something was missing from a check in- git should be able to back up to older versions of dfhack and/or stonesense to see if they work better.
