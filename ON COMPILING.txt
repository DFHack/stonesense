There are ten thousand things to say here, and I'll get into more details later,
but for now; This project aint all that compiler friendly yet.
I'm just getting the project out there, so the public light will force me to tidy up stuff.


1 - You will need Allegro, the graphics library we use. Get it at http://alleg.sourceforge.net/

2 - I've only tested it with MSVS 2005

3 - It includes a partially mangled version of dfHack. It should work, but a more elegant solution is in the works. 

Specific Build Notes
====================

*** MinGW ***

(I am including specific version numbers here so I can give precise file info, as things
update, you may have better luck with newer versions)

1) Get cmake-2.6.4-win32-x86.exe from
http://www.cmake.org/files/v2.6/cmake-2.6.4-win32-x86.exe
and install

2) Get MinGW-5.1.6.exe installer from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Automated%20MinGW%20Installer/

Install with:
g++ compiler
MinGW make (this didnt want to automatically grab today, you may need to manually install it)

3) Get subversion checkout of stonesense (PySVN Workbench works nicely)
see http://code.google.com/p/stonesense/source/checkout

4) Get allegro-mingw-4.2.2.zip from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/alleg/files/allegro-bin/

Unpack allegro into the stonesense directory
(so you have a stonesense/allegro-mingw-4.2.2 directory)

* Yes you need the whole lot not just the libs *

(If you have a newer allegro, change its directory name, or tweak the directories in CMakeList.txt)

5) add any missing .cpp files to the CMakeList.txt list under

SET(PROJECT_SRCS

(or wait till the compiler process winges about them to help figure out what is missing)

6) *** You will need to either set up paths to MinGW and CMake in your environment or
a dos shell for the following steps ***

something like

set path=c:\Program Files\CMake 2.6\bin;c:\MinGW\bin;%path%

7) Run the build-MinGW32-release.bat batch file

* If you are running in a dos prompt, you will need to be in the build directory *



*** Linux ***

1) Get the source

svn checkout http://stonesense.googlecode.com/svn/trunk stonesense

2) Get the libraries

Your distro should have dev packages for allegro, libpng, and zlib
You will also need make, cmake and a g++

3) Run the built in make

cd stonesense/build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:string=Release
make
