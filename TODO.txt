For A4:
Finish floor and wall config
---
For later versions:
Animation when not auto-reloading - wont work without complete rewrite
Non-uniform walls, fluids, etc
Add configurable key bindings
Interrupt driven input- debounce keys?
Better creature name handling- special characters? Capitals? nicknames?
Alpha transparency?
Better ramp handling- Big lookup table?
Status indicators?
only loading matgloss tables once per valid map
Objects?
XML for trees, etc
Dealing with unloaded underground chunks
Look into reducing block new/delete for performance
Multiple XML files for other types of sprites
Multiple image files for other types of sprites
Floor sprites with different material types? Layered floor sprites ala buildings?
Height indicators for floating/flying stuff
Debug cursor should interact with map more
---
Things to keep an eye on:
Crashers with odd materials etc
Crashers with saving/loading
