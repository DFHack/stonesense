For A4:
Finish floor and wall config
Properly handle bad DF connections- seems ok?
Add libpng3 to main directory?
Grab that still from the forum? Is there a finished version yet?

For later versions:
Animation when not auto-reloading - wont work without complete rewrite
Add configurable key bindings
Interrupt driven input- debounce keys?
Better creature name handling- special characters? Capitals? nicknames?
Alpha transparency?
Better ramp handling- Big lookup table?
Status indicators?
Objects?
