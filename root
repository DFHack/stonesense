I'm pretty sure that this is the stonesense debug cursor, and it should probably be disabled in overlay mode to avoid disrupting normal play with tools such as the mousequery plugin.  \n\nThe second is that there appears to be an offset between the tile which is clicked, and the tile to which the action is applied.  Using mousequery and the vanilla right-click painting, the designation (cursor) appeared to be offset by [-2,3] from the mouse.  This may vary with screen size or the size of the 2D tiles beneath the overlay; I intend to do further tests soon.  The [-2,3] result is with a 16x16 tileset, and 1366x768 screen.","files":null}]}
