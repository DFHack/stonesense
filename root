The dwarf fortress window stops updating the screen.\nThe dfhack console still works.\n\nNo error message is generated.\n\nExample save file with a trade caravan in the fortress: https://github.com/tildetown/tilde-df/tree/b2056a945ee5f6adbeb5a186e0cadc5cb0784d2b\n\nI'm running this on 64bit Archlinux. I have tried both the AUR version (dfhack 0.43.05-r1), and a manual install of dfhack 0.43.05-r2.\n\nI strongly suspect that it's the wagon causing the crash, but it's possible that some other part of the caravan is the cause.","files":null}]}
