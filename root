It would be good to write more comprehensive docs, like the new DFHack documentation.  I'll try to get to this sometime, but probably not before a couple of DF releases.  If done appropriately, it could be integrated in the same way as the df-structures docs on https://dfhack.readthedocs.org\n\nRelated to DFHack/dfhack#648","files":null}]}
