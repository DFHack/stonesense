The text below is included in docs/dev/Documentation.rst - see that file for more details on the changelog setup.
This is kept in this file as a quick syntax reference.

===help

changelog.txt uses a syntax similar to RST, with a few special sequences:

- ``===`` indicates the start of a comment
- ``#`` indicates the start of a release name (do not include "DFHack")
- ``##`` indicates the start of a section name (this must be listed in ``gen_changelog.py``)
- ``-`` indicates the start of a changelog entry. **Note:** an entry currently must be only one line.
- ``:`` (colon followed by space) separates the name of a feature from a description of a change to that feature.
    Changes made to the same feature are grouped if they end up in the same section.
- ``:\`` (colon, backslash, space) avoids the above behavior
- ``- @`` (the space is optional) indicates the start of an entry that should only be displayed in NEWS-dev.rst.
    Use this sparingly, e.g. for immediate fixes to one development build in another development build that
    are not of interest to users of stable builds only.
- Three ``[`` characters indicate the start of a block (possibly a comment) that
  spans multiple lines. Three ``]`` characters indicate the end of such a block.
- ``!`` immediately before a phrase set up to be replaced (see gen_changelog.py) stops that occurrence from being replaced.
